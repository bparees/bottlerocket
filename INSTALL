INSTALLING BottleRocket:
-----------------------

./configure
make
make install

Note: The Makefile assumes that your make program
is GNU gmake; if this is not the case, you will need
to hand-edit the Makefile for your platform after
running configure.  If you need help, email me
(my email address is in the README file).

That's it!  Note that BottleRocket requires access to
the serial port that your FireCracker is plugged into,
so you need to be root to use it, or set it up setgid
(generally group "tty" under Linux, "dialers" under
FreeBSD, check with someone you trust if you're not
sure how to set this up) for other users to use it (this
is definitely recommended over making it setuid).
It's always a good idea to look over code that you're 
going to be running with elevated privileges (do that
now!) to make sure you're comfortable with it having
higher privileges.  Also be aware that just making it
setgid (or uid), executable by anyone, means that 
*anyone* on your system can use it to turn thing on/
off, and IT IS POSSIBLE TO CAUSE A MODEM PLUGGED IN
THROUGH THE DYNAMITE MODULE TO LOSE CARRIER.  If the
process is killed at the right time, DTR and/or RTS
will be set low and can remain that way.  There is
no way to stop a user from sending a SIGKILL to a
process that they have run, even if it's setuid/gid, on
at least most operating systems that I'm familiar
with.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

You can now specify the serial port (or a link to a
serial port) from configure; use

./configure --with-x10port=<device>

to do this.  Use

./configure --help

to get a full list of options you can pass to configure.

I recommend using --with-x10port=/dev/firecracker and
adding a symbolic link from /dev/firecracker to whatever
device your firecracker is plugged into; this makes it
easy to move the firecracker to another port if you
so choose.
